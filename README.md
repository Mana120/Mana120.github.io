# ZERO-DOWNTIME-ROBOFEST
UI/UX design (web page) which consisted of 3 types of robots 1. Autonomous Robots 2. Assistive Robots 3. Manually controlled robots
Autonomous robots consisted of a simple pick and place robot. It shows the simulation of real FANUC robot and showed the users tasks the robot performs autonomously. Assistive robots consisted of welding robot. We gave the user and option to start, stop and resume the robotâ€™s simulation. The manually controlled robots allows the users to manually control the robots configuration.
The main aim of this project is to allow the user with little or no knowledge in robotics to build a robot, understand the functioning of a robot and how actually the robot moves.


**This project was done as a part of 24hr Robofest 2.0 hackathon conducted by PES University
